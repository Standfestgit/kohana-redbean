kohana-redbean
==============
A __very__ basic integration of [Redbean](http://redbeanphp.com/) into [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) v3.3..

Install
-------
* Add as Kohana [module](http://kohanaframework.org/3.2/guide/kohana/modules).
* Get redbean repo by running `git submodule update --init` from within the redbean module directory.
* Copy the config/redbean.php to your application/config/redbean.php and add your DB settings.
* Check out Redbean's documentation.

Notes
-----
* This code is very early and is only enough to get something working ATM.
* I'm building this with Kohana v3.3 in mind.
